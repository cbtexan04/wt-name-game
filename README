** Employees
    - For ease-of-development (being able to look up employees easily by ID,
      primarily), I created a -very- simple employee API used to list all the
      employees, or give details of a single employee

* Employee Query Filters:
- Filters may be applied when searching for employees
- Supported filter params are "id", "firstName", and "lastName"

GET the list of employees
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/employees

GET a single employee by ID
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/employees/<id>

** Game
    - There were a number of things I would have liked to continue to develop
      for the game API, however I simply ran out of time. I implemented a basic
      API for listing played games, getting specific game details, deleting a
      game, creating a game, and solving a game.

GET past and present games:
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/games

GET details of an existing game:
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/games/<id>

Solving a game
- Done through a PUT (as opposed to a POST), as the game state is being changed
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/games/<id> -X PUT -d '{"solution": "<employee_id>"}'

POSTing to create a new game
- We can specify a game-type parameter of 'matt' or 'standard'
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/games?game-type=matt -X POST

DELETing a Game
- Remove a game from being tracked
- curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/games/<id> -X DELETE

** Leaderboard
    - Simple leaderboard which allows us to see which users have solved the
      most games. The only interaction I had time for was a simple GET

GET leaderboard
curl -u willowtree:password http://localhost:1234/api/1.0/leaderboard
